Lyric Finder
========

### API application

This small test app uses [Metro Lyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com) API to search for songs by lyrics. This was my first look into using API's. It follows from the example [Alex Peattie](https://github.com/alexpeattie) used of creating an app which finds github users.
